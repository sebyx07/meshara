   - Strategic direction
   - Breaking tie votes
   - Release approval
   - Membership: Elected annually by contributors

2. **Core Maintainers** (5-15 members)
   - Code review and merging
   - Release management
   - Security response
   - Membership: Appointed by steering committee

3. **Contributors**
   - Submit PRs
   - Report issues
   - Participate in discussions
   - Membership: Anyone with merged PR

4. **Users**
   - Provide feedback
   - Report bugs
   - Participate in community
   - Membership: Anyone using Meshara

**Decision Making**:
- **Consensus**: Preferred for most decisions

## RFC Process

### Proposing Changes

**RFC (Request for Comments) Process** for significant changes:

**When to Write RFC**:
- Breaking protocol changes
- New major features
- Architectural changes
- Security-sensitive changes

**RFC Template** (rfcs/0001-template.md):
```markdown
# RFC 0001: [Title]

- **Start Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **RFC PR**: #123
- **Tracking Issue**: #456

## Summary

One-paragraph explanation of the change.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What problems does it solve?

## Guide-Level Explanation

Explain the proposal as if teaching it to another Meshara user.

## Reference-Level Explanation

Detailed technical explanation.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this the best design?
- What other designs were considered?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior Art

Similar features in other projects.

## Unresolved Questions

What parts of the design need to be resolved during implementation?

## Future Possibilities

How might this be extended in the future?
```

**RFC Workflow**:
1. **Draft**: Author creates RFC PR
2. **Discussion**: 2-week comment period
3. **Revision**: Author addresses feedback
4. **Vote**: Core maintainers vote (requires 2/3 majority)
5. **Accepted**: Merged to rfcs/ directory
6. **Implementation**: Tracking issue created
7. **Stabilization**: Feature implemented, tested, documented

## Succession Planning

### Bus Factor Mitigation

**Current Risk**: If key maintainer leaves, project stalls.

**Mitigation**:
1. **Documentation**: Everything documented (no tribal knowledge)
2. **Multiple Maintainers**: At least 3 people per critical area
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Pair programming, code reviews
4. **Onboarding**: Clear path from contributor to maintainer
5. **Redundancy**: No single point of failure

**Maintainer Emeritus**:
- Inactive maintainers become "emeritus"
- Retain advisory role
- Can return to active status

# POST-MVP ROADMAP: MESHARA PRODUCTION READINESS

## Overview

This roadmap defines the path from **MVP completion** (Phases 1-5) to a **production-ready, enterprise-grade library**. The MVP provides core functionality; post-MVP ensures security, reliability, performance, and developer experience meet professional standards.

**MVP Completion Baseline** (what we have after MVP Phase 1-5):
- ✓ Working cryptography (Ed25519, X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, Blake3)
- ✓ Protocol Buffers messaging with versioning
- ✓ Encrypted storage and configuration
- ✓ Node API with event system
- ✓ TLS 1.3 networking with mDNS discovery
- ✓ Multi-hop routing with gossip protocol
- ✓ Authority nodes with signed updates
- ✓ Basic test coverage and examples

**Post-MVP Objective**: Transform Meshara into a library that companies can deploy in production with confidence.

## Post-MVP Philosophy

### Production Readiness Pillars

1. **Security Assurance**: External audits, fuzzing, vulnerability management
2. **Performance at Scale**: Benchmarks, optimization, resource efficiency
3. **Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, debugging, incident response
4. **Developer Experience**: Documentation, tooling, integrations, support
5. **Ecosystem Growth**: Community, plugins, reference implementations
6. **Long-term Sustainability**: Maintenance, governance, roadmap

### Success Metrics

| Metric | MVP Target | Production Target |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Security Audit | None | Full external audit by reputable firm |
| Test Coverage | Unit tests only | 90%+ coverage with integration, fuzzing, chaos |
| Performance | Unoptimized | <50ms p99 latency for 10KB messages |
| Documentation | Basic API docs | Full guides, tutorials, runbooks, architecture docs |
| Monitoring | None | Full observability (logs, metrics, traces) |
| Platform Support | Linux only | Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, WASM |
| Network Scale | 10-100 nodes | 10,000+ nodes tested |
| Package Management | Crates.io only | Multiple language bindings, package managers |
| Community | Solo dev | Active community, contributors, commercial users |

## Phased Approach Rationale

### Why This Order?

**Phase 1 First**: Can't deploy to production without security and reliability.
**Phase 2 Second**: Advanced features build on hardened foundation.
**Phase 3 Third**: Developer experience improves adoption.
**Phase 4 Fourth**: Operational readiness enables scale.
**Phase 5 Fifth**: Ecosystem grows after solid foundation.
**Phase 6 Ongoing**: Sustainability requires mature project.

### Parallel Work Opportunities

Some phases can overlap:
- Phase 3 (docs, bindings) can start during Phase 2
- Phase 4 (monitoring) can start during Phase 1
- Phase 5 (ecosystem) can start during Phase 3

### Critical Path

**Must be sequential**:
1. Security audit (Phase 1) before public v1.0 release
2. Performance optimization (Phase 1) before scale testing (Phase 4)
3. Core features (Phase 2) before bindings (Phase 3)
4. Monitoring (Phase 4) before production deployments

## Timeline Overview

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Phase 1: Production Hardening | 8-12 weeks | 3 months | Security audit passed |
| Phase 2: Advanced Features | 12-16 weeks | 7 months | Full feature set complete |
| Phase 3: Developer Experience | 10-14 weeks | 10 months | Multi-language support |
| Phase 4: Operational Readiness | 8-12 weeks | 13 months | Production deployments live |
| Phase 5: Ecosystem Development | 12-16 weeks | 17 months | Thriving ecosystem |
| Phase 6: Long-term Sustainability | Ongoing | Forever | Sustainable open source project |

**Total Time to v1.0 Production Release**: ~13-17 months from post-MVP start

## Version Numbering Strategy

### During Post-MVP Development

- **v0.1.x** - MVP Phase 1 complete (crypto, protocol, storage)
- **v0.2.x** - MVP Phase 2 complete (Node API)
- **v0.3.x** - MVP Phase 3 complete (networking)
- **v0.4.x** - MVP Phase 4 complete (routing)
- **v0.5.x** - MVP Phase 5 complete (authority)
- **v0.6.x** - Post-MVP Phase 1 complete (security hardened)
- **v0.7.x** - Post-MVP Phase 2 complete (advanced features)
- **v0.8.x** - Post-MVP Phase 3 complete (developer experience)
- **v0.9.x** - Post-MVP Phase 4 complete (operational readiness)

### Production Releases

- **v1.0.0** - First production-ready release (after Phase 1-4)
- **v1.x.x** - Backward-compatible feature additions
- **v2.0.0** - Breaking protocol changes (rare, avoid if possible)

### Semantic Versioning Guarantees

**Stability Promise**:
- v0.x.x: Breaking changes allowed between minor versions
- v1.x.x: Breaking changes only in major version bumps
- Protocol compatibility maintained for 2+ major versions

## Relationship to MVP

### MVP Provides:
- Core functionality
- Proof of concept
- Foundation for iteration
- Basic usability

### Post-MVP Adds:
- Production-grade security
- Enterprise reliability
- Professional documentation
- Operational tooling
- Ecosystem integration
- Long-term sustainability

**Critical**: Post-MVP is not "nice to have" features. It's the difference between a prototype and a product.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete MVP Phases 2-5** (current priority)
2. **Plan Phase 1 Security Audit** (select auditing firm, budget)
3. **Set up Fuzzing Infrastructure** (OSS-Fuzz application)
4. **Begin Performance Baseline** (benchmark suite during MVP)
5. **Start Documentation** (architectural docs parallel with development)
